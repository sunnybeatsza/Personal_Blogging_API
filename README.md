# RESTful API for a Personal Blog

This is a RESTful API that would power a personal blog. 
The following are the features that are implemented. 
The articles will be stored in a file for now as this is a small scale project.
- Return a list of articles. You can add filters such as publishing date, or tags.
- Return a single article, specified by the ID of the article.
- Create a new article to be published.
- Delete a single article, specified by the ID.
- Update a single article, again, youâ€™d specify the article using its ID.
